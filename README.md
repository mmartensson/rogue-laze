# rogue-laze

Rogue Laze is a rogue-like that requires no player interaction at all to progress. A random seed and a starting point in time
is all that constitutes a play session and you are then welcome to have a look at how your character is doing at any time.
Watch the action live, be it light shopping in town or a slow treck through the next dungeon. Or just check in a couple of
seconds every day until the character eventually dies and the game ends - but is forever saved; at least until the next version
of the game which will invariably make use of the available pool of random numbers differently, causing another timeline to
take place.
